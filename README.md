# Welcome
This is my portfolio website repo. Its meant to be deployed to github pages, so it is entirely static, and relies on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will be using Bootstrap as the frontend library. 

## Features to be implemented
- [x] Loading wheel
- [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle
- [ ] Parallex Scrolling
- [ ] Hobbies Carousell
- [ ] Headers and Footes 
- [ ] Add Personal Brand Logo
- [ ] Onload animations 
- [ ] and more!

### Future Plans
I would like to change this to a dynamic page, and host it elsewhere, such as on Heroku or Firebase
Implement a mobile friendly version of the page so that it can be viewed from anywhere
